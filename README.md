# JavaFX-tetrecs-game
JavaFx inspired tetrecs game, which is a spin off of the infamous game tetris, with unique game design and logic for a university project.
It used to connect to a uni server, but i believe that server got shut down, so i removed code logic for setting up a websocket to make it run 
Multiplayer in development
